Conceived in the wake of a series of distressing personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure for West from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explored themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandoned conventional hip hop sounds in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, which included prominent use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine. Despite varying responses from audiences, the album received positive reviews from most critics and was named one of 2008's best records in several year-end lists.")

The Life of Pablo was noted for its raw, occasionally even intentionally messy, composition in distinction to West's previous albums.the album's frequent meditations on matters of faith, family, and West's own role as a cultural figure while observing that Pablo frequently (some might say abruptly) toggles between Sad Kanye and the bombastic and celebratory Kanye.")

Following a period of public and legal controversy, West retreated to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii in 2009. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.")
